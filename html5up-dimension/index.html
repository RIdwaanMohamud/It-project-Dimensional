								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My name is Ridwaan Mahamud (s3784620@student.rmit.edu.au). I am a somalian who was born in New Zealand but was raised in Australia, completing my highschool education in 2018. I am fluent in both english and somali as well. Some of my favourite pastimes include gaming and reading books, as well as hanging out with friends.</a>.</p>
								<p>VARK: Visual 7, Aural 9, Read/Write 8, Kinesthetic 12. Multimodal leaning preference. Myers-Briggs: "Adventurer (ISFP-A). Big five personalities test: O-27%, C-35%, E-29%, A-75%, N-37.5%. These results show me many things. One main one is the fact that it shows improvements that can be made on my psyche to improve in various aspects. These results don't influence my behaviour in a team as they are merely results and do not conclude on what I can or can't do. As such, they only tell me the types of people who I am best suited to work with and not much more.								</p>

								<h2 class="major">Intrest in Information Technology</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>For me, I have been around computers my whole life, since about 6. I was always intrigued by them and how they worked, so there was always this underlying intrest. After doing Computing in year 10 and experiencing coding first hand, a desire to code and make things was born, especially since I enjoyed playing video games. </p>
								<p>I chose to go to RMIT since it was a university which specialised in this field(Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. I expect to learn how to make programs, code sufficiently and be able to develop my own program, to help others or to entertain.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/38619435?type=standout&searchrequesttoken=22d6e2b5-ce5b-4b3a-a4cc-e9b68a1a9305 My ideal job consists of devloping software, mostly on back-end, since it appeals to me more than the interface and UX. I hope to be able to have these sorts of skills by the time I graduate, perhaps work in a firm for a few years before being able to work in a highly skilled career.</p>
							<p>This specific job entails working on the backend of software, ensuring that the program runs smoothly, as well as working in teams and collaborating on projects. Much of IT today requires teamwork in order to make better software that helps to accomplish the clients needs. Some core skills requied by this job are experience with Javascript and HTML, both things that I am currently in the process of aquiring knowledge about.</p>
							<p>Some others include the ability to take responsibility for ones work and being able to work with a team, 2 things that I beleive I am already capable of. As such, I beleieve that upon graduating from thos bachelor and some firsthand experience, I will be ready to work in such a career without any issues.</p>
							<p>Working hours: preferably a typical 9-5, with at least 45m worth of breaks all up. Although 9-5 is preferred, some variations of a few hours earlier (2-3) with the same decrease in time finishing, although less may be ideal for more overpay. 
Pay: Pay, likewise scales with hours and the job itself. As such, assuming the work is highly specialized, the pay should be a salary of 80 thousand+ or 45+ per hour.
Location: Given my own horrible sleeping patterns and tendency to be late, a job within 5km would be preferred, although an exception can be made to 10km max.
Flexibility: A job where I can work from home, as well as working at the actual worksite would be ideal, given the chance that something could occur that needs my urgent attention and doesn’t allow me to go to work. Something like this would definitely have some sort. 
Variety of work:  I would like a variety, as doing the same work for ages is extremely annoying. A variety of work is better to keep on task.
Skills required: Preferably skills that I can attain from completing this bachelor, although many jobs list quite a few skills that are unattainable upon graduation (such as experience).
Amount of creativity: Although a stale job would be boring, I would want a job that has the least amount of creativity necessary, as I am not a creative person who likes to explore and venture into new things; I enjoy work staying rigid with some change every now and then.
Prospects for travel: While travel itself is not an issue, having to work immediately upon arrival, especially for longer flights would be exhaustive and not worth it. As such, travel within a limit of 20km or so by driving and 6 thousand km by flight would be ideal.
Level of teamwork: Working in a team is fine, as long as everyone takes a professional approach and completes their allotted work within the deadlines given to them.
Amount of interaction: I am not a very talkative person to those distant from me, especially people like workmates. Unless I befriended those at work and felt comfortable talking to them, I would not interact much with them. As for those externally, I wouldn’t mind putting up some sort of façade as they are people who drive the business.
Opportunities for growth: I would prefer a job with opportunities over those without, but if the job already gives a large pay 90 thousand+, then I wouldn’t mind having no opportunities to upgrade, so to say.
Thinking about software development, thinking about making a game or perhaps making software for clients based around what they would like from it. As well as this, I am interested in learning more programming languages so that I can excel in the field. Perhaps bug testing may be a decent variable to complete, although I am not entirely sure about whether it would be a good idea as well.
I am interested in the idea of also making a game, as I have some friends interested in the field of creating such software to profit from it since a lot of us do make games.
